### Dr. Toya White

ChiropractorBorn and raised in West Tennessee, Dr. Toya attended the University of Tennessee at Martin where she completed research and studied the human body. She earned her bachelors degree in cell and molecular biology and went on to study patterns of health and disease at the University of Memphis where she earned a masters degree in epidemiology.After studying disease pathways and going through her own health issues, it was clear that using drugs as the primary intervention wasn’t the solution. The body is beyond capable of healing itself given the proper support. Why weren’t we discussing this?Dr. Toya attended Logan University in St. Louis, MO where she spent countless hours learning the Gonstead method, a comprehensive and specific chiropractic technique. Having benefited tremendously from Gonstead chiropractic care herself, Dr. Toya proudly cares for families in the Nashville area using this specific system.

### Dr. Courtney Simon

ChiropractorDr. Courtney grew up in small town Iowa with her family and was involved in a variety of sports growing up. It was during her senior year of high school that she started throwing up dozens of times every day and after months of doctors appointments and tests, she visited a chiropractic office. Within the first few visits she noticed a night and day difference and it was then that she realized how powerful the nervous system is and how chiropractic can impact all areas of health.She went on to obtain her Bachelor’s degree in Exercise Science at Central College in Pella, Iowa. During these years as she was developing a deeper love for how the human body works and simultaneously forming a desire to live a sustainable holistic lifestyle, she knew it was her calling to become a chiropractor!Dr. Courtney attended Life University in Marietta, Georgia where she graduated Summa Cum Laude. During her time in the Doctor of Chiropractic program she was introduced to the Gonstead Technique and later became a leader of the University’s Gonstead Club. The specificity and unique care for each patient spoke to her desire of how she wants to care for patients. She believes that everyone’s nervous system and chiropractic care should be as unique to them as their appearance, life experiences, and goals are. Dr. Courtney is also certified in the Webster Technique and has attended several seminars to continue to learn how to best serve her patients. She is proud to serve the Nashville community with the specific chiropractic care that she believes every person deserves.

### the Gonstead technique

Of the hundreds of different chiropractic techniques practiced all over the world, one of the most well-known and highly respected is the Gonstead Method.This is the technique that we choose to utilize at Evergreen. Gonstead chiropractic is named after Dr. Clarence. S. Gonstead (1898-1978). Before becoming a chiropractor, Gonstead worked in the field of engineering. His background gave him a unique perspective when studying and analyzing the human frame.His unparalleled work ethic, combined with his desire for constant improvement and understanding of spinal mechanics in relation to the nervous system led to the development of one of the most sought after chiropractic techniques in the world.What Makes the Gonstead Technique Different?Before we adjust your spine, we take the time to analyze and investigate how your spine works and what it needs to work most efficiently. The pillars of the Gonstead work are as follows:Visualization-how does the patient in front of me look today? Are they in pain, are they sitting in a certain way to try to avoid pain?Instrumentation-Gonstead doctors use a Nervoscope, a fancy word that just means a thermometer on the surface of your spine to search for areas of inflammation. This helps us to pin point exactly which vertebra is causing your symptoms, and helps us to be as specific as possible with your care.Static Palpation-How are your bones positioned when not moving?Motion Palpation-How effectively are your bones moving (or not moving) when you start to move around. All joints should have some degree of regular motion to them, when they do not, that is usually when you know it is time to visit our office.X-ray Analysis-“To see is to know, not to see is to guess” We never guess when it comes to your health. A full spine x-ray allows us to analyze in which way your spine has moved so that we can adjust it with the least invasive method possible.A Gonstead doctor takes all of the above mentioned tools to put together the puzzle that is each individual patient. The more we can understand about your spine, the better able we are to serve you and your healthcare needs.

### CFT/Gillespie therapy

Craniosacral Fascial Therapy (CFT)is the work ofDr. Barry Gillespie. It is based on his theory that the Craniosacral and Fascial systems are not separate but one interconnected system. CFT blends the two established modalities of Dr. William Sutherland's Cranial Sacral Therapy and John Barnes' Myofascial Release, along with dental techniques developed from Dr. Gillespie’s experience as a periodontist.People often ask what is the difference between Craniosacral Therapy (CST) and Craniosacral Fascial Therapy (CFT)? and how does Myofascial Release (MFR) fit into the mix?In CST no one mentions the clinical importance of the fascial web.If you study Tom Myers, Gil Hedley and John Barnes' brilliant teachings you’ll get a glimpse into the fascial web. We find the determining healing factor for our patients is in this web. If the fascia can be free, patients do well with CST; if the fascia remains tight, CST has little or no effect.We believe the fascial web appears to rule the craniosacral system. We believe that the marriage of these two great therapies, craniosacral and myofascial, into Craniosacral Fascial Therapy (CFT) is the key. We also find that CFT is profound in releasing cranio- dental strain and oral dysfunction that can contribute to a tight system.We find that if we truly listen closely to full-body strain patterns, we obtain the best results.We find that each human holds the emotional and physical memories from in utero, and delivery traumas and knows innately knows how to heal themselves. When the fascial web is fully released, the cranial bones and sacrum amazingly seem to correct on their own.We have 2 practitioners in the office who offer CFT: Dr. Brittney and Meghan.

### pregnant moms

One of the most important times for Nashville women to see a chiropractor is during pregnancy.Seeing a prenatal chiropractor is important for both mom and baby. The changes in a woman's body during pregnancy put added stress on the spine and nerves. This is why things like sciatic pain are so common during pregnancy.Maintaining chiropractic care during pregnancy will help the body adapt to its temporarily altered state. The result is a more comfortable pregnancy and shorter labor times.Dr. Brittney is certified in the Webster technique, which is a technique designed just for pregnant women! It supports breech babies in being able to turn themselves head down.

### newborns

Trauma during the birth process is way more common than most people think. Often, it goes undetected.Let's face it. Being born is not easy. Even in the most uncomplicated births, there is a lot of pulling and pushing on a baby's head and neck. Add in forceps, vacuums, and c-sections, and now the stress put on your baby's body has multiplied.According to Dr. Guttman, M.D., when looking at over 1,000 infants shortly after birth, over 80% of them sustained trauma to their cervical spine. He also found associated symptoms, ranging from movement and developmental impairment to lowered resistance to infections, especially to ear, nose and throat infections.(Source: Blocked Atlantal Nerve Syndrome in Babies and Infants, Manuell Medizin 1987 25)In chiropractic, we call this trauma "subluxation." Subluxation causes nerve irritation. Since our nervous system controls every function in the body, if we have interference/irritation to our nervous system, we will not be able to grow or develop to our full potential.Dr. Brittney is also trained in the Gillespie Approach craniosacral fascial therapy. This is a bodywork specialty that is especially helpful for infants with lip or tongue tie restrictions. The therapy can be used to prepare your baby for a release procedure or in place of one entirely. Click below to learn more about it!

### kids

From learning to walk, run, ride a bike and play sports, kids fall hundreds, if not thousands, of times. More often than not, when we have trauma as a child, adults tell us to shake it off and get back in the game.What people don't realize, is that many problems that we experience as adults stem from injuries that we had as children. If these problems get detected and corrected early on, they are much easier and quicker to fix.Children also experience micro trauma every day from spending hours sitting at desks in school, slouching while playing video games, and watching television.Being sedentary and sitting with poor posture causes structural and neurological stress to the body.If neglected, these issues continue to worsen and can cause serious challenges when we become adults. The best time to start chiropractic care is now, with a pediatric chiropractor, before the problems occur.

---

### adults

Whether you're a professional athlete and live an active lifestyle, or your daily routine is a bit more relaxed, getting adjusted by a Gonstead Chiropractor should be top on your list of health priorities.Most people think that chiropractors help with back pain, neck pain, migraines, car accidents and other pain-based symptoms. In reality, this is asmall sampleof what chiropractors do. Chiropractic maximizes the body's performance and helps you reach your full potential.Countless studies demonstrate how much more effectively and efficiently our bodies function when under chiropractic care. From increased athletic performance toavoiding illness, adults seek chiropractic care when they want to be at their best.

---

### athletes

Many athletes benefit from seeing a sports chiropractor because it keeps them in peak condition without the use of drugs. Whether it’s during the season or in the off-season, sports medicine chiropractic care is becoming the competitive advantage that many athletes are now seeking. When your body is in better alignment, your nervous system is finely tuned, and all pistons are firing. This leads to better performance, fewer injuries and quicker recovery.Case Study: Chiropractic Improves Vertical Jump HeightA recent studyanalyzed the effect of a pelvic adjustment on female university students with functional leg length inequality. Researchers divided the students into two groups. One group received chiropractic adjustments using a technique called Gonstead pelvis analysis. The other group received physical therapy and stretching exercises.Both groups noticed an improvement in leg length inequality, however, only the group that received the Gonstead adjustments had an increase in their vertical height jump.Conclusion: Chiropractic can improve athletic performance.

## faq.html

What is a chiropractic adjustment?


---

It is a small thrust applied to the body (misaligned vertebra) from the hands of a chiropractor.


---

Will I see results right away?


---

This depends on a number of things like the nature and history of the illness. Sometimes, chiropractic results may be achieved very quickly. Other times, it may take weeks to months because of changes that have occurred in the body in response to the subluxation(s).


---

Will my pain be relieved?


---

In many instances, taking pressure off the nerve is all that is needed for relief of pain.


---

Can children be adjusted too?


---

Yes! It is best to have children checked for subluxations as early as possible. This will ensure that they are fulfilling their own potential to live and grow as healthy as they can.


---

What is the difference between what Evergreen docs do and other chiropractors?


---

The biggest difference is the Gonstead Difference. Our doctors use the Gonstead System of analyzing and adjusting the spine which means that we are very specific in finding your problem areas and in delivering precise adjustments. Learn more about the
Gonstead System.


---

Can chiropractic help more than just back pain?


---

Absolutely. It can help because when you receive a chiropractic adjustment, nerve interference is removed which allows your body to function better. Simply put, it helps your immune system kick in so that your body can heal itself.


---

Can chiropractic help me?


---

Chiropractic care will benefit almost everyone in some way, just as dental care will benefit almost everyone in some way. How you respond depends on how long you have dealt with your pain/symptoms, your lifestyle and your compliance to the care plan.


---

How many visits will I need?


---

That depends on your unique situation. Each injury/situation is different and each individual’s healing response is different. I will give each patient an estimate on how long their recovery may take after the initial exam and will have an even better idea after 2-3 visits. This office does not have the same “3x a week for 6 weeks” approach for every patient. When beginning Chiropractic care in an acute condition, you may need to be adjusted more often in a short period of time to begin the healing process. Each visit builds on the next, so remain hopeful… we are! Visits will be spaced out based on your individual needs and the rate of improvement.
Once your initial complaint has improved or resolved, you may choose to maintain periodic checkups to reduce future episodes and for better overall health.


---

Are chiropractic adjustments safe?


---

Absolutely! In fact, a New Zealand government study found that adjustments are “remarkably safe.” It is the result of biologically sound, specific adjustments without the use of drugs or surgeries that has given Chiropractic care an excellent safety record.
In comparison, 16,000 – 20,000 people in the US die each year from complications (bleeding ulcers and heart attacks) caused by over-the-counter pain relievers. Roughly 7 out of 1000 people will die from “routine” neck or back surgery. Many others suffer long-lasting side effects of scar tissue buildup and structural instability caused by surgery.


---

How do I know if I have a subluxation (misalignment)?


---

Oftentimes you can have a subluxation and not even know it! They can be present before you have obvious symptoms, like the progression of tooth decay. The best thing for you and your family is to be checked in our office with a thorough examination for the presence and severity of subluxations. After being adjusted you may find you are able to listen to your body and know when you are in need of future care.


---

Can I adjust myself?


---

No. Turning your body or neck in one direction and/or the other may make your joints “pop”, but that sound is not correcting the problem and certainly is not an adjustment! The pressure and gases released during that “pop” may immediately feel like relief, but only a licensed Chiropractor is able to adjust the actual misaligned vertebra that’s really causing the tension. Even our doctors visit colleagues to get adjusted (and adjust each other!


---

Are you going to “crack” my whole spine?


---

As Gonstead Chiropractors, we carefully analyze your spine to determine which segments need to be adjusted and which should be left alone. With Chiropractic care, more is not better. “Cracking or manipulating” your entire spine is not specific in the least and does not provide the lasting results that carefully adjusting only specific segments does. The goal is to correct the exact cause of the problem and let your body do the rest of the healing.


---

Why do newborns get adjustments?


---

The birth process, no matter how natural, can affect an infant’s spine. Some studies suggest that colic, unusual crying, poor appetite, ear infection or erratic sleeping habits can be signs of spinal distress. Newborns also become subluxated in the same physical, emotional or chemical ways an adult does as well. An infant is also examined very carefully to determine if there is a subluxation and, if needed, receives a gentle Gonstead adjustment involving very little pressure.


---

Do I have a slipped disk?


---

No. The disc is a cartilage pad between each of your spinal vertebra that aides in your spine’s connection, flexibility, movement, weight bearing & shock absorbing ability. Motion in your spine produces a pumping action to each disc allowing nutrients to enter and waste to be expelled. Because of spinal subluxations or severe trauma a disc can bulge, swell, tear, herniate, thin, dry out or collapse but it can’t actually “slip” out from between the spinal bones it serves. The Gonstead Chiropractor pays special attention to your disc health. Dr. M gently corrects the misaligned vertebra and restores it to a proper position in relationship to the disc, allowing the disc to heal.


---

I’ve had back surgery, can you still help?


---

Yes. Surgery often leads to instability in your spine above or below the area operated on. Your Gonstead Chiropractor will be very specific to your problem areas and will avoid the surgically altered segments.


---

How long until I feel better?


---

Happily, a lot of our patients have reported immediate relief. Others experience slow progress over a period of days or weeks. There are many factors that play a role in your healing process, including the severity or length of your injury. Other factors include proper rest, nutrition, exercise, keeping your appointments and closely following our doctors recommendations. The timing of your appointments are carefully determined based on your need for re-adjustment and time for healing. Please let our doctors know how you are doing from visit to visit, we will appreciate your honesty.


---

I’ve heard that once you get adjusted, you have to keep getting adjusted.
Is that true?


---

This is only true if you want to utilize the gift of chiropractic as a lifestyle, similar to an exercise, dental, or wellness program in contrast to utilizing it as a “get of out pain” service. People have found that efforts put into wellness and prevention carry you further in life’s experience than dealing with sickness as it arises. By receiving regular chiropractic adjustments, people find that they have more energy and motivation, handle stress better, perform better, sleep better, amongst many other things.
Once your initial complaint has improved or resolved, you may choose to maintain regular checkups to reduce future episodes and for better overall health.

### The Gonstead Technique

What sets our office apart…The Gonstead Technique was developed by Dr. Clarence Gonstead over 90 years ago. We are the only office in Nashville that practices this technique! Here are the highlights:We take full spine x-rays on every patient so we can see what is going on on the inside.We do a full exam on every visit so that care is customized to how your body presents that day. No 2 adjustments are exactly alike.The biggest difference? We adjust the spine without rotation and we only move one bone at a time. That means no terrifying ninja moves or twisting your neck up side to side. We are the chiropractors for people who are scared of chiropractors!For more information on the Gonstead Technique,click here

## cft-gillespie.html

WHAT IS CFT?
Craniosacral Fascial Therapy (CFT) is a very gentle, natural approach with powerful therapeutic effects.
Craniosacral Fascial Therapy
is the work of
Dr. Barry Gillespie
. It is based on his theory that the Craniosacral and Fascial systems are not separate but one interconnected system. CFT blends the two established modalities of Dr. William Sutherland's Cranial Sacral Therapy and John Barnes' Myofascial Release, along with dental techniques developed from Dr. Gillespie’s experience as a periodontist.
What is fascia?
Basically, fascia is the body’s connective tissue, providing a framework that helps support and protect muscles, organs, and the entire body as a unit. It is an all-encompassing web found throughout the body that protects the entire body as a whole. It envelopes organs, muscles, nerves and even blood, for protection from outside trauma. It supports the musculoskeletal system and allows us to perform functional activities like walking, jumping, running, or simply changing position.
The intricate
craniosacral fascial system
originates in the body's core around the brain and spinal cord, and extends through the fascial web. A healthy system allows for the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, down the spine, to the sacrum, and into the fascia.
How is fascia damaged?
All of us have experienced trauma --- difficult birth, surgery, auto accidents, falls, concussions, dental work/orthodontics, vaccinations, and emotional trauma, to name a few. Starting from birth, traumas accumulate and can create strain and toxicity in the craniosacral fascial system, restricting critical brain motion. Damage to the craniosacral fascial system can cause poor blood flow, diminish nerve impulses, hinder brain function, limit range of motion, and cause a host of other ailments.
How does CFT help?
Our brains must expand and contract. Any restrictions or damage to this motion can greatly effect our health and wellbeing.
CFT techniques are designed to gently unwind and release accumulated fascial strain. This allows optimal mobility and better brain function. When the Craniosacral Fascial System is loose and open there is free flow of cerebrospinal fluid to help nourish and cleanse toxins.
CFT is effective for all ages and benefits a variety of conditions.

What exactly is a Tongue Tie?
We all have a frenulum which is tissue on the underside of our tongue connected to the floor of the mouth.  When this tissue is too short, too thick, too tight, and attached too far forward on the tongue, it will affect mobility, function and the tongue’s resting posture. In some cases, a tied frenulum may not be visible (known as a submucosal tie). A tongue tie condition is often accompanied by a lip tie or cheek ties (also known as buccal ties). All of these conditions are referred to as Tethered Oral Tissues (TOTS).


---

What causes Tongue Tie?
Tongue tie is often associated with a fairly common genetic mutation of the MTHFR gene. This gene controls the production of an enzyme called Methyl-Tetra-Hydro-Folate-Reductase.  People with a variant on this gene have a difficult time processing folate or folic acid which can can contribute to other midline defects as well as general health issues. Research shows 30-50 percent of the population carries this mutation of the MTHFR gene.
Why does it matter?
Your tongue should be resting in the palate and filling the entire roof of your mouth. This allows for optimal palate development. A wide palate allows enough room for teeth to come in straight and guides proper cranial bone and orofacial development.  A restrictive tongue will sit in the lower part of the mouth, causing mouth breathing, open mouth posture and a tongue thrust swallowing pattern. These can contribute to an obstructed airway leading to sleep, breathing, and other OMDs.
For Infants:
Since the tongue has been tethered during fetal life, it is likely that the infant will have a high palate because it is the tongue's position in the roof of the mouth that forms the wide palate. This may affect the ability to breastfeed efficiently. Breastfeeding issues may include noisy sucking, clicking, popping on/off breast, leaking milk from sides of mouth, gagging, blisters, inefficient nursing and pain for the Mom.  Other tongue tie related conditions may include reflux, colic, poor sleep, poor weight gain, digestive issues and general fussiness.


---

For Children and Adults:
You may be surprised to learn that many  “common” health issues are related to a Tongue Tie or improper oral function. Some of the related conditions are mouth breathing, speech issues, excessive cavities, narrow palate, crooked teeth, recessed jaw, dark circles/tired eyes, poor posture, difficulty chewing, picky eating, messy eating, slow eating, large tonsils, ADHD symptoms, anxiety, poor sleep, bed wetting, snoring, sleep disordered breathing/sleep apnea, neck and shoulder tension, headaches, grinding/clenching.
The proper placement of the tongue ultimately contributes to the aesthetics of your face by developing a wide arch palate, a strong mandible, strong orofacial muscles, facial symmetry,  and attractive head shape.

## visceral-therapy.html

### Visceral therapy

is a gentle, manual therapy that helps restore natural movement and function of the viscera (organs). Just like muscles and joints, our organs need to move freely to function properly. This manual technique was developed by physician and physical therapist Jean-Pierre Barral.

---

Barral’s work is based on the theory that each organ has a specific rhythm and path of movement. Your organs naturally move as your breathe, digest and perform other bodily functions. When restricted due to injury, infection, surgery, or inflammation, the normal movement is disrupted. This leads to fascial tension and imbalances that can manifest as various health issues; including digestive, menstrual and chronic pelvic pain.
Visceral therapy is designed to work with your body’s natural healing process and achieve balance. It helps to release deep-seated tension and restriction in the body.


---

If you are experiencing digestive discomfort, menstrual pain, or chronic tension, visceral therapy can offer gentle relief and support your body’s natural healing. Book a session to experience Visceral therapy and restore balance, improve function, and feel more at ease in your body.

Embodied Breastfeeding is a 90 min group session hosted by Dr. Brittney & Meghan Thornburgh
We are here to support you & your baby where ever you are in your feeding journey: breastfeeding, bottle feeding, currently bottle feeding but want to get back to breastfeeding, etc.
If you have been told your baby has an oral tie and you’re not sure what to do next, we can help. If you are preparing your baby for a frenectomy (tie release procedure), we can help. If you had the frenectomy done with your baby & didn’t get the outcomes you were looking for, we can help.
