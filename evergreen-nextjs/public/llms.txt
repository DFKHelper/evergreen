## The Gonstead Method

The Gonstead technique uses five criteria to analyze the spine:
1. Visualization - observing posture and movement
2. Instrumentation - using a Nervoscope to detect inflammation
3. Static palpation - feeling the spine at rest
4. Motion palpation - assessing spinal movement
5. X-ray analysis - understanding spinal structure

We adjust only the specific vertebra that needs correction, with no twisting or rotation.
