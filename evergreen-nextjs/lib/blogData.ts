    content: `Neck pain affects more than 50% of the population and is one of the most common issues resolved by chiropractic adjustments. The main cause of neck pain stems from cervical (neck) misalignments and forward head posture. These can easily occur due to increased muscle tension/spasm, chronic postural stress, poor sleeping position, whiplash trauma, etc.

Millions of people consult with a chiropractor for neck pain relief on a daily basis. The benefit of chiropractic neck adjustments is to restore cervical (neck) alignment. This reduces degeneration and inflammation, and leads to improved posture, function, and mobility. Those who experience neck pain (both acute and chronic) show dramatic improvement following chiropractic care.

Visiting a chiropractor for a comprehensive spinal assessment and adjustment can restore proper alignment and relieve pain quickly and effectively. To further support your neck and prevent issues from reoccurring, we'll discuss a preventative care plan and may suggest supportive stretching and home exercises.`

    content: `Like most, you're probably overlooking a crucial factor to supporting a healthy spine: your choice of footwear.

Just as a solid foundation is essential for constructing a sturdy building, a proper alignment of the spine forms the basis of good posture and a healthy spine. You balance from the ground up, this starts with your feet.

They support your entire body weight and absorb the impact when you walk, run, or jump. The foot and ankle complex includes 28 bones, 33 joints, 112 ligaments and 34 muscles.

Shoes with inadequate support or too much cushioning places unnatural force and stress on our muscles and joints. This causes an imbalance in our kinetic chain, leading to over-rolling of the foot in or outward.

Notice how over-pronation (rolling inward) or supination (rolling outward) of the ankle leads to imbalances at the knee, hip and even the shoulders. For these reasons, it's important to choose shoes that will not only support your feet, but also protect your spine.

**How to choose the right footwear**

When selecting footwear, it's important to consider the specific needs of your feet and body. Different activities require different shoes due to the demand on the body. Prioritize quality, comfort, and support when making footwear choices for different activities. Looking for shoe recommendations? Check out minimalist footwear or Barefoot shoes that allow your feet to bend and flex naturally.`

    content: `You may not initially think of a chiropractor when it comes to helping with digestive issues, but think again. There is an intimate link between spinal misalignments (particularly in the low back) and digestive issues.

A chiropractor can help you understand this link and receiving chiropractic adjustments can dramatically improve digestion and bowel regularity.

**The link between your spine and your digestive system**

A healthy digestive system requires a healthy spine. In fact, the nerves that control your digestion pass through the vertebrae or bones in your spine. The lumbar and thoracic regions of your spine regulate how fast or slow food is processed.

Notice how the nerves in the mid and low back go directly to the gastrointestinal organs: stomach, small and large intestines.

When the vertebra are misaligned or aren't moving properly, this will cause disruption of your digestive function. This includes constipation, diarrhea, cramping, acid reflux, indigestion and even IBS. If you're experiencing digestive issues that don't have an obvious cause, it's worth visiting a chiropractor and discussing how they can help you find relief.

At Evergreen Chiropractic, we help patients ease digestive issues daily.`

    title: 'Seeing a Chiropractor: One-Time Visit Vs Long-Term Care',
    author: 'Brittney McGetrick',
    date: '2024-08-23',
    excerpt: 'Is it possible to visit the chiropractor once and never return? Well, how often you visit the chiropractor depends entirely on your goal of chiropractic care.',
    content: `Is it possible to visit the chiropractor once and never return? Well, how often you visit the chiropractor depends entirely on your goal of chiropractic care.

People visit the chiropractor for many different reasons: back and neck pain, preventative care, sports injury rehab, migraine relief, scoliosis care, etc.

The primary goal of most chiropractors is to restore optimal function and mobility for their patients. This looks different for every patient, of course and will require more visits.

But what if you're just wanting one visit or two?

**One-time visit to the chiropractor**

Chiropractic care is very effective for everyone. In fact, most individuals notice an incredible difference just after the first adjustment. Even those with more chronic conditions experience great relief in just a few adjustments. If you're satisfied with the relief after one or two adjustments and you're not interested in preventative or long-term care, that's an option. But if you want to experience optimal function and mobility or just want to take extra precaution to avoid re-injury, you'll need to opt for long-term care.

**Long-term or Preventative Care**

The entire body benefits from ongoing care; this approach has numerous advantage beyond just preventing pain. It keeps the spine and body in proper alignment to support organ health, better immunity, increase lung function, and even reverse chronic disease. The duration of the care plan depends on the condition, severity of the damage and how well the patient is responding to care. The number of visit gradually decreases over months as the body is improving and stabilizing.

**The Bottom Line**

The duration of your care plan depends on your health goals. During your first appointment, be sure to let your chiropractor know your goals and together, you can decide what is best for you: a one-time visit or long-term care.

**Detecting Subluxation: Early Warning Signs**

When it comes to our health and well-being, prevention is ALWAYS better than cure. This is especially true when it comes to spinal health and the detection of subluxation. Subluxation refers to a misalignment of the vertebrae in the spine leading to a multitude of health concerns if left untreated.

For optimal health and development, it's important to understand that just because you don't have pain doesn't mean that you are free of misalignments or subluxations. There are many more ways your body can communicate with you outside of pain. By the time pain occurs, your body is basically screaming at you for help.

Early warning signs of subluxation include:

1. **Postural Changes**: Pay attention to any changes in your posture. If you notice that you are slouching, getting a hump or that your shoulders or hips are uneven, it could be a sign of subluxation.

2. **Chronic Headaches**: Frequent headaches and migraines can be a sign of subluxation in the cervical spine.

3. **Limited Range of Motion**: The spine is meant to move freely and be flexible. If you find it difficult to move your neck or back freely, it could be a sign of subluxation.

4. **Numbness or Tingling**: Subluxation can also affect the nerves that run through the spine.

5. **Digestive Issues**: The nerves in the spine also play a crucial role in the functioning of the digestive system.

If you notice any of these early warning signs, it is crucial to seek professional chiropractic care. At Evergreen Chiropractic, we use the Gonstead method of care to give our patients the highest quality of care.`

    title: '5 Misconceptions About Chiropractic',
    author: 'Brittney McGetrick',

    category: 'Chiropractic',
    excerpt: 'When you hear the word "chiropractor", what comes to mind? Let\'s de-bunk the 5 most common myths about chiropractic.',
    content: `When you hear the word "chiropractor", what comes to mind? Chances are, everyone who just read that line has a different image in their head of what chiropractors do and what chiropractic is capable of.

While there is a lot of variation within the chiropractic profession, I'm going to do my best to de-bunk the 5 most common myths about chiropractic:

**1. They aren't "real" doctors**

Chiropractors go to medical school after completing a 4 year bachelor's degree, just like western medical doctors do. Chiropractors also have more hours in certain topics like: anatomy, diagnosis, microbiology, neurology, & orthopedics. The only difference in chiropractic vs medical doctor education is in our additional study requirements. Chiropractors have additional study in spinal manipulation, nutrition, x-ray, and physical therapy, while medical doctors have additional study in drugs and surgery.

**2. You have to go forever**

You do not have to go to the chiropractor forever, just like you don't have to eat healthy food forever, or brush your teeth forever, or get oil changes in your car forever. Your body (& car) will certainly run better when you keep up healthy habits, but you're never required to do them.

**3. The adjustment is the "crack"**

If a chiropractor makes an adjustment & no one hears it, did it really happen? Short answer: yes! Just because you hear a "pop" or "crack" does not mean an adjustment occurred, and if you don't hear a noise, that does not mean an adjustment did not occur. The purpose of a chiropractic adjustment is to adjust bones of the spine back into proper alignment, which takes pressure off the nervous system & allows the nervous system to function properly.

**4. It's only for low back & neck pain or headaches**

Remember that nervous system we were just talking about? That is really what chiropractic is all about. Helping to alleviate low back pain, neck pain, and headaches is the least interesting part of my job. The really exciting stuff is when I help women heal from PCOS, reduce period cramps, help babies who are constipated go poop, improve the latch in breastfeeding babies, reduce anxiety in patients who have tried everything else, and so much more.

**5. It's expensive**

Chiropractic care can easily fit within anyone's budget. When you compare the cost of what chiropractic saves you, it becomes a no-brainer to make it a regular part of your life. There was a 7-year study conducted that showed that patients whose primary physician was a chiropractor experienced:

- 60% less hospital admissions
- 59% less days in the hospital
- 62% less outpatient surgeries
- 85% less in pharmaceutical costs

That is a savings of multiple thousands of dollars every year, far more than you would spend at your chiropractor for regular maintenance visits.`

    excerpt: 'Have you ever thought of your spine as an Oreo cookie? If your vertebrae are the cookie part, & your disc is the cream filling... what\'s the best way to separate the cookie from the cream?',

    content: `**Have you ever thought of your spine as an Oreo cookie?**

If your vertebrae are the cookie part, & your disc is the cream filling... what's the best way to separate the cookie from the cream?

**Twist it, right?**

This is why, as Gonstead Doctors, we never twist your spine when we adjust you! We focus on keeping your discs safe while restoring motion to your joints, which results in pressure coming off of your nervous system in the safest way possible!

Additionally, when a bone misaligns, it goes backwards first. Bones don't misalign by twisting around, so why would twisting them up correct the misalignment? (hint: it won't)

This is often why people will see results with Gonstead chiropractic that they didn't get with other forms of chiropractic, because we are correcting the misaligned bone in the proper way.

It is this difference that makes Gonstead chiropractic a great option for people who are unsure about getting adjusted, usually from some crazy videos they have seen of adjustments on YouTube or Tik Tok.

I have been getting some questions recently on neck adjustments. Most of the time we do them when you are face down on the knee chest, and sometimes we do them in the chair! But they are still never done with rotation, because that is not beneficial to your joints.

**What can you do to support your joints other than Gonstead chiropractic?**

We put together a joint support bundle just for that!

- **Deep relief roller** - apply this to your spine after adjustments to support blood flow & tissue healing
- **CBD muscle rub** - use this on tight muscles on days when you can't get in for an adjustment
- **Sulfurzyme powder or capsules** - support your joints from the inside out with this MSM supplement that gives your body the building blocks it needs to heal the cartilage in your joints!`

    excerpt: 'Does your first cycle after the holidays have you feeling extra cranky? Here\'s why...',
    content: `**Does your first cycle after the holidays have you feeling extra cranky? Here's why...**

First let's talk about why women get PMS in the first place: not enough progesterone.

Progesterone is our happy hormone. It helps stabilize our moods, it also is the hormone that we need in order to get pregnant. We have progesterone receptors in our skin, liver, brain, all over our body. A fertile body is a healthy body. When we are fertile, we look better & feel better.

In the 2nd half of your cycle (the week or 2 before your period starts) there is a natural dip in hormone levels. If you don't have enough progesterone to begin with & those levels dip too far... then we get the PMS monster coming out to play.

**What lowers levels of progesterone?**

- Stress (our bodies release cortisol instead of progesterone when stressed)
- Unstable blood sugar levels
- Drinking alcohol
- Too much estrogen
- Lack of ovulation (being on the BC pill does this)

Stress, unstable blood sugar, drinking more than usual, & being exposed to estrogenic chemicals (grandma's perfume, soy ingredients in holiday dishes, plastics in tupperware, etc.) ... All of these holiday exposures can send our progesterone levels down the toilet & our PMS symptoms skyrocketing.

**What can we do?**

Don't worry, you don't have to suffer through PMS just because family drama sent your cortisol levels through the roof. We have solutions to help balance your hormones naturally.

Just because you're a woman, that doesn't mean you have to live with pain & moodiness each month. You can learn to love your cycle & tap into the power that it has to help you live a more fulfilled life.`

    content: `**This is a question we hear often at Evergreen Chiropractic...**

A chiropractic adjustment re-aligns your vertebra and helps to take pressure off your nervous system. This helps to reduce inflammation & allows everything in your body to function better. Between adjustments, the best thing you can do to help your body out is to strengthen the muscles around your spine, eat well, and take supplements that support your joints.

**Strengthen your spine:**

- Most basic yoga classes cover all your bases here! They help with balance, core strength, and spine strength
- You can do yoga at home (there are lots of free yoga videos on YouTube)
- Maintaining an active lifestyle is one of the best things you can do for your spine health

**Eat well:**

- In order for your joints to heal, your body needs enough nutrients to do so!
- Eat lots of: red meat, organ meats, eggs, raw dairy, fermented foods, fruit, & root vegetables and you're off to a good start!

**Supplement:**

Our modern life can make it hard to get all the nutrients we need from food alone, here are some supplements we recommend everyone to take, that can help with most health goals:

- **Ningxia red** - this is a wolfberry puree antioxidant drink that has loads of antioxidants & nutrients
- **Sulfurzyme** - this is an MSM supplement that supports healthy joints and detoxes heavy metals
- **Beef organs** - the most nutritious part of the animal, parts that our ancestors used to eat regularly
- **Vitamin E** - helps to counteract the destructive effects of vegetable oils`

    excerpt: 'We all know what the circadian rhythm is... did you know that women also have an infradian rhythm? That is our 28 (ish) day cycle that affects our moods, energy levels, libido, and overall well being!',
    content: `We all know what the circadian rhythm is... did you know that women also have an infradian rhythm? That is our 28 (ish) day cycle that affects our moods, energy levels, libido, and overall well being! Learning about the phases of your cycle and doing your best to change your behavior with each phase can actually help ease your period symptoms like PMS and period cramps!

Let's take a look at how you can expect to feel during each phase and how you can get the most out of each one:

**Part 1: Menstruation phase**

This is the week of your period. Day 1 = first bleed day, and it lasts until about day 7.

Think of your menstrual phase as winter. This is a time to slow down, prioritize self care, and not take on too much.

Normal bleed times are anywhere from 3-8 days. Anything shorter or longer is considered irregular.

**Part 2: Pre-ovulation**

This is ~days 7-13 of your cycle, or the week after your period!

Pre-ovulation is like spring time! You will feel your energy levels & enthusiasm steadily increase during this week.

You will feel up for spending more time with friends or learning a new skill. Words come easy during this phase, it's a great time to give a presentation or make an important call!

**Part 3: Ovulation phase**

Usually days 13-21 of your cycle. Ovulation phase is like summer time!

This is the only time during your cycle when you are able to get pregnant!

During this phase you may feel more nurturing, compassionate, & a lot more passionate!

This is when you usually feel your most social, and if you are able to tune into the creative, productive, expressive energy of this phase, you become a master manifester!

**Part 4: Pre-menstruation**

This is the week before your bleed, usually day 23 -> until you start your period.

This is when your hormones begin to withdraw. This can cause some anxiety, nervousness, & a decrease in serotonin.

When you learn to hone in on the power of this phase, you become a truth-seeking, no bullshit, master of speaking your truth.

This phase is an opportunity for spiritual insight, straight talk, & truth speaking. If it doesn't feel right in your heart & body during this phase, don't do it.`

    excerpt: 'I see it all the time, drug commercials with healthy young people in them, normalizing prescription medication for seemingly young, fit, healthy people.',
    content: `I see it all the time, drug commercials with healthy young people in them, normalizing prescription medication for seemingly young, fit, healthy people. When did we let this become a new normal? And is it "normal"?

Common does NOT equal normal. Many aspects of modern society that we humans have grown accustomed to are not normal, despite them becoming more and more common.

My name is Dr. Brittney McGetrick and I believe in the body's ability to heal itself, and in its innate ability to be as healthy as possible if we give it the right tools. There are 4 main areas that I believe have the biggest effect on your health:

**1. Your Nervous System**

Your nervous system controls every single thing that happens in your body. It is what tells your heart to beat, your cells to divide, your immune system to turn on, and your muscles to move. Nothing in your body happens unless your nervous system tells it to.

The goal of chiropractic care is to optimize the function of your nervous system.

**2. Your Diet**

We know that food affects our health. When it comes to eating in a way that fuels our bodies and gives us the building blocks for health, we need to think of two things: eating foods that are good for us and avoiding foods that are damaging to our bodies.

Here are the basics for what I believe consist of a healthy diet: red meat, animal fats, vegetables, some fruit, very little grain, no wheat, no sugar, definitely nothing artificial.

**3. Your Movement**

Movement is medicine! Our bodies are made to move. The key here is to make it FUN! Move more days than you don't, make it fun, and if you can, get outside at least a couple times per week!

**4. Your Mindset**

Last, but certainly not least, how you think and how you feel can be more important than the previous 3 points combined. Our minds are POWERFUL.

What you say to yourself everyday has an impact. Do you trust the innate intelligence of your body? Do you celebrate your wins, like eating a healthy meal & moving your body?

These 4 pillars are just a start. If they feel overwhelming, that's okay. Start with one, do it until it feels natural, and then move on to a second pillar. This life is meant to be fun and lived to its fullest!`
